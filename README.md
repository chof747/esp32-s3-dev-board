# ESP32-S3 Development Board
Minimal development board for an ESP32-S3 MCU.

It contains the following elements:

- Programming header with DTR/RTS mechanism
- Power LED
- Fuse to prevent the worse
- Jumper to disconnect 3v3 from the programmer to be able to test e.g. battery mode while still debugging
